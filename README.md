# Cyber Range Lab – Nicholas Vidal

> ⚠️ **This project is a work in progress (WIP).**  
> Updates are ongoing as I build out my home lab infrastructure.

This is a hands-on Red Team and Blue Team cyber range built using real hardware, virtual machines, and Active Directory simulations. It serves as both a personal training ground and a live documentation project for others looking to build their own range.
