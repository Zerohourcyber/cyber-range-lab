# Cyber Range Roadmap – Nicholas Vidal

This is the high-level strategic plan for building and operationalizing a personal cyber range over the next 6 months.

---

## 🧱 Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup  
**Objective:** Establish all baseline systems, storage, and networking to support Red/Blue/AD simulation

## ⚔️ Phase 2: Red & Blue Team Integration  
**Objective:** Deploy and configure attacker/defender systems, log telemetry, and establish visibility

## 🧠 Phase 3: Active Directory & Threat Simulation  
**Objective:** Build a full AD environment with realistic attack chains and start adversary emulation

## 🧪 Phase 4: DFIR + Memory Forensics + Detection  
**Objective:** Capture evidence, analyze volatile artifacts, and build detection playbooks

## 🚀 Phase 5: Capstone + Portfolio Output  
**Objective:** Package lab outputs into walkthroughs, publish reports, and integrate into portfolio
